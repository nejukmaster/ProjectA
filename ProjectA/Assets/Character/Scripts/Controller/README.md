Character Controller
====================
This chapter describes the process of creating C# scripts to move characters. The basic character movement uses Unity's built-in script, the Character Controller script, and this component is received from the Player Controller to implement the character's movement. 

### Player Contorller Script

Before implementing the player's movements, first set up for multi-play using Unity Netcode. Create a Network Manager and register the Player you created before PlayerPrefab.
